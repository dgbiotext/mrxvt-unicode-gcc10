According to https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85678, a switch was made such that gcc in verisons 10 and up defaults to acting as if the -fno-common flag was provided. Versions 9 and earlier default to acting as if -fcommon was given.

This change breaks compilation of mrxvt.

This fork of the code simply adds '-fcommon' to the configure.ac file to fix this issue.

Build dependencies are mostly listed in the  usual mrxvt documentation, but extras will increase capability; on Debian, for example, I would suggest 

sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev libjpeg9-dev bison

Also, the bootstrap does not just need autoconf, it also needs bison if it is to work. That's on top of your build-essential stuff (like a compiler!). That's why I've listed it above.
